# A Small AI Model Comparison Tool (A Learning Project Built with AI's Help)

Hello!

Thank you so very much for being willing to open this page and consider trying out this small program I wrote.

Before you begin, please allow me to first sincerely apologize and be transparent about a few of the most important things:

1.  **AI Collaboration Declaration**: The vast majority of the code for this project was completed under the "hand-holding" guidance and writing of an AI (Gemini Pro). I am not an IT professional, nor am I a computer science student. My major is unrelated to computers. All of this was accomplished by my continuously asking the AI questions, learning, and finally "assembling" the code snippets it generated. Therefore, it is more accurate to call this a learning exercise I completed *with* an AI, rather than my own work.

2.  **[IMPORTANT] Tested on Linux Only!**: Because I only have a Linux server on hand for learning and testing, **this project has currently only been successfully run in a Linux environment.** The installation steps I've written for Windows and macOS were compiled based on online research and AI suggestions; **I have not had the opportunity to personally verify if they work.** If you encounter failures on Windows or macOS, it is highly likely due to subtle differences between operating systems. This is a limitation of my own skills and resources, and for that, I am truly, truly sorry!
3.  **My First Project**: I have never created a project before this one, and this was also created to fulfill a school assignment.

Precisely because of the three points above, the code almost certainly contains various unforeseen errors and bugs (especially in the newly added features!). If it suddenly crashes during your use and causes you trouble, I once again sincerely apologize!

### The Initial Idea and Its Evolution (Why does this exist?)

It all started with a very simple personal need. I love experimenting with various large AI models, but I found that to know which AI answers a question better, I had to constantly switch between several web pages, which felt incredibly clumsy.
would be more perfect.
I wanted to know which model was the true "top student" over the long run. So, we added a simple **rating system**. Later, I felt that just looking at scores was meaningless because I couldn't remember why I had given a high score. So, I had the AI models review each other's answers and generate new responses based on the suggestions. I personally feel this way
is more fun! While using the projects of masters is certainly effective and enjoyable, watching a project of your own grow from zero is even more exciting. Because this is a project made for fun, it is certainly far from being as stable or easy to use as similar products. I hope everyone can understand.

### Features I Attempted to Implement with the AI

*   **Configure Your Own AI Providers**: I told the AI I needed a form to fill in API Keys and other information. The AI generated the frontend HTML and backend Python code for me.
*   **Query Multiple AIs Simultaneously**: I asked the AI how to "send requests to multiple URLs at once with a single click," and the AI had me use technologies I had never heard of before, like `asyncio` and `aiohttp`.
*   **Run Locally for Security**: I emphasized to the AI that "I am very concerned about API Key leakage," so the AI suggested I use a local SQLite database and ensure all sensitive information remains on the user's own computer. Note: For security, do not run this project on a device that is not your own.

### Feature Screenshots

This is what it looks like after finally running successfully under our "collaboration" (I hope it's the same on your computer!):

### How to Run This on Your Computer (An AI-Generated "Dummy-Proof" Tutorial)

Most of this tutorial was also generated by an AI after I asked it, "How do I write a tutorial that a complete beginner can understand?" I will do my best to use my own words to explain the potentially confusing parts more clearly.

**Reminder: The following steps have been verified on Linux. They are theoretically feasible on Windows and macOS but have not been tested!**

#### Step 1: Install Python (The "Engine" of the Program)

*   First, you need to install something called Python. You can think of it as the engine that drives our little "factory."
*   Please go to the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download a recent version (e.g., Python 3.11).
*   **Crucial Step!** During installation, be sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. Checking this will save you a lot of trouble later.

#### Step 2: Download My Code

*   At the top-right of this page, there is a green `<> Code` button. Click it, then select **`Download ZIP`**.
*   After the download is complete, unzip it to a convenient location on your computer (like your Desktop).

#### Step 3: Create a "Virtual Environment" (to keep your system clean)

1.  **Open your command-line tool**:
    *   **Windows**: Press the `Win` key, type `cmd` or `powershell`, and press Enter.
    *   **macOS**: Go to "Applications" -> "Utilities" and open "Terminal".

2.  **Navigate to the project folder using the `cd` command**:
    *   Type `cd` followed by a space. Then, drag and drop the folder you just unzipped from your desktop into the command-line window. Its path will appear automatically. Press Enter.

3.  **Create the virtual environment** (this creates a `venv` folder):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    *   On **Windows** (**unverified**):
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On **macOS** or **Linux** (**Linux verified**):
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    If successful, you will see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

#### Step 4: Install All the "Parts" (Dependencies)

While in the activated environment (with `(venv)` visible), run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 5: Start the Program! (The most exciting part)

Everything is ready. Run the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
If all goes well (fingers crossed!), you will see a line indicating that the application is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

#### Step 6: Access the Program

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.



### Now with Docker Support!
```bash
docker pull safg/ai-peer-review-platform:latest
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-review-app safg/ai-peer-review-platform:latest
```

### Final Thanks and Apologies

Thank you again for taking your valuable time to read this document and for being willing to try this little thing that the AI and I cobbled together.

If it fails to run (especially on Windows or macOS), or if it causes you any confusion or inconvenience during use, I am truly sorry. This is all due to my lack of skill and limited testing conditions. You are welcome to let me know about any problems you encounter by using the `Issues` tab at the top of the page. I will take your questions and consult the AI again, and strive to fix the problems with it.

I will humbly accept any and all suggestions and criticisms. Thank you, everyone
